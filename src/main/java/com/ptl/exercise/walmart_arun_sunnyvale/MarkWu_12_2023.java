    /* Coding: Given array of integers a and target t, find triplets satisfying the condition
         1. a[i] < a[j] < a[k]
         2. a[i] + a[j] + a[k] < t
         tips: 3 for loops work, but she wants better solution
         She likes the solution below:
              1. sort the array
              2. one for loop from 0 to len-2
              3. inside use two pointers
         * looks like the interviewer is not really caring about condition 1 -- order of 3 numbers

     * Coding: Check if 2 strings are anagrams
     * Answer: we used hashmap, one for loop to loop 2 strings, 1st string we add to map, 2nd string 
     * we reduce count from the map
     * then we use another for loop to check if map value are all 0s
     * 
     * interviewer asked if we can make it into 1 for loop, we told her impossible - looks like she 
     * doesnot realize that 1 for loop is not gonna work.
     * but she let Mark pass anyway.
